## Hi I am Daniel ðŸ‘‹
About me
I'm 22 years old.
I studied high school at cbtis 59 in the technical programming career in which I formed my programming foundations.
I am a graduate of computer science from the UAEH where I specialized in intelligent computing.
My main programming language is Python, but I have extensive knowledge of a wide variety of programming languages â€‹â€‹such as Java, JS, C++, C# and PHP.

My experience
Until now I have not had a formal job in this field but in my professional internship I was working in a web development and digital marketing company where I learned concepts about SEO and SEM, in addition to using technologies for web development such as HTML, CSS and PHP.
